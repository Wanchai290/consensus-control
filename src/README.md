# Consensus control and CBF experiments
## Usage

Python files should be run from the root folder (where `ibuki_lab` and  `src` reside)
and launched in the following manner

```bash
python3 -m src.discrete
```
for the `src/discrete.py` file. This was necessary to be able to use the `src` folder as a library.
